 
I coded this checkpoint challenge as part of the series in learning Javascript. 
By the end of the challenge I've gained a better understanding of the following:
  1. what a DOM means - acronym for Dcoument Object Model, essentially the glue that
  connects Javascript and a rendered HTML page. 
  2. What are DOM events - the "something" that happens in a web page or app, and to
s   use the appropriate Event for the current situation.
  3. Create and use custom Event Listeners and methods.
  4. Recognize and use common ES6 features like const. let. and arrow functions.

  To-do app : A simple to-do app that I coded using Javascript. 
  This to-do app allows the user  to create their to-do list and to mark them  existing to-dos as complete.
